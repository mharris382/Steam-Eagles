see iteration [[Iteration 23 - Characters Overhaul]]


so I basically went through every file in the Characters assembly.  Not surprisingly, I found the majority of these files were prototypes that had already been replaced or assumed that they were to be replaced.   However, many of these files still have a number of asset references, some have code references.  Any that did not have asset or code references were deleted. 

I also depricated everything in the Ability system assembly with the intetion that these functions will be relocated to a subset of the [[Tool System]] (which currently does not exist)
