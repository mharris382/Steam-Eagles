#level-design #reflection 

I worked on some level design concepts, although I haven't done very much (if at all) in the past few days. 

- make sure to define win/lose conditions
- base the way to complete a task on the simplest, dumbest way to do it
- don't limit yourself by things that aren't actually in stone yet (like the design of the ship, or really anything at this point)

**The Takeaway**
I need to be more involved in Unity, like actually playing with what we have available. I also shouldn't limit myself to what we already have; it's good to build upon what's already available and imagine new mechanics that can be added onto them.
