**Level Design** 
- expanded on level design idea for the tutorial that Max and I had (mostly Max):
	- airship s connected to an engine on the ground
	- player has to connect hook up the reactor(s) so that they are self-powered after the airship lifts off
 - [[Tutorial Level|my idea]] was for the player to power-up a reactor by redoing the pipes so that the reactor's input is itself instead of a battery
 - battery is just an energy storage container, same idea as a gas tank
	 - limited capacity

**teaches the player**
- what a battery is and how it works
- the concept of input and output
- how the reactors work
- how to destroy, build, and connect pipes

## What I learned
- it's good to share your ideas
