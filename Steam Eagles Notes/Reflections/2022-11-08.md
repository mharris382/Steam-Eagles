#reflection #ui 

**I started the day by:**
- (binge) watching The Dragon Prince
- eating an egg salad sandwich
- watching more Dragon Prince
Basically I started the day doing, well, nothing productive

# Designing the pipe flow UI
Max and I designed a working prototype of the pipe flow UI. It is how the player will be able to tell if the pipes are connected and which direction the steam is flowing in. My original plan involved arrows and honestly would've looked really bad and stupid. Max came up with the idea of animating a gradient along a line renderer. The gradient would move in the direction of the flow. Much prettier and cooler than arrow heads. 
This is what we ended up with. It's hard to tell, but there are yellow lines running from the output to the input.

Max showed me how to write the shader for it and explained what each part meant. I'm pretty sure I got it, only time will tell. I'm feeling pretty good right now so onto the next important UI: the turbine(s).
