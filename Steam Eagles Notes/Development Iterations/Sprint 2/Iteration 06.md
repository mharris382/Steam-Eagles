# Iteration 06: Refactoring 
Previous Iteration: [[Iteration 05]]



## Goal

1. Identify the most important game systems
2. check how they are currently implemented (if at all)
3. consider reorganizing systems 

### Hypothesis

## Fundamentally Important Game Systems

### Input
input is probably the most important system (as there is no way for the player to interact without input).  

#### User Requirements
- Supports multiple input device schemes
	- Keyboard Mouse
	- Controller
- Supports singleplayer or local multiplayer game modes
- most actions should be remappable
	- exceptions are actions that use mouse positions

#### Software Requirements
- uses Unity's Input System package
- requires Camera assigned player instances


# UI
user interface is the next most important system (or possibly tied at first), but it is less straightforward than input.  Currently UI is the system most in need of centralization
