# Iteration 15: experimenting with power graph
Previous Iteration: [[Iteration 14 -  Save Loading]]
Next Iteration: [[Iteration 16 - Damage Systems Prototype]]


## Goal
One area of implementation which is going to be important but I'm not 100% sure on is the power grid.  Specifically how to render the wires so that the wires which have power are colored to indicate that some wires have power
