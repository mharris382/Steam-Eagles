#ui 
full screen UI window. Standard character selection menu, requires input devices to function.  Window cannot be closed until all connected input devices have selected a character and there is at least one connected input device.  Registered devices should show the player numbers.   Character selections are made by moving device icon to the right or left.  Unassigned devices are displayed in the center of the window.  This window is used to switch character assignments in co-op mode.  Character selection will only ever *need* to occur once per playthrough when a new game is started, but may occur as many times as players wish.

title: Quick Assignment for debugging
There should be an editor option to skip the assignment step and just assign player 1 to the builder for the purpose of debugging and playtesting in the editor.
