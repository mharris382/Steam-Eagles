# Iteration 25: Mechanism Subsystem
Previous Iteration: 
Next Iteration: 


## Goal
wanted to test the extensibility of the save system and put in a framework that will allow the building to have physics based mechanisms that connected to the building.  The *physics-based* attribute is essential here because it establishes the proper subsystem for anything that is part of the building which it's own dynamic rigidbody.  For the dynamic rigidbody system to work there cannot be any kinematic rigidbodies inside the building.  SO if we want anything like an elevator, we need a new subsystem.



### Purpose
establish framework for the building to have dynamic rigidbodies that are attached internally via joints
