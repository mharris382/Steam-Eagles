## Goal

### Purpose
so recently I ended up in a conversation with some other developers about the best way to handle spawn positions.  [I proposed a solution](https://pastebin.com/c9nVQkje) to their problem which I ended noticing could be a good solution to my own problem with spawning (which was not working). 

### Hypothesis
use spawn database to handle resolving spawn positions
