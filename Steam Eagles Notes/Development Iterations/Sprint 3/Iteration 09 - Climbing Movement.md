# Iteration 09:  Climbing Movement
Previous Iteration:  [[Iteration 08 - Aerial Movement on airship]]
Next Iteration: [[Iteration 10 - Spawning and Scene Management]]

 
## Goal

### Purpose
we need to solve the issue of creating seamless, enjoyable vertical movement within the airship.  Since the previous attempt to use jointed movement did not work for jumping/falling, the simple answer is to implement climbing instead.  

Actually now that I think about it, should also consider stepping as well.
