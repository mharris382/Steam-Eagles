I've been feeling very anxious today for some reason, and haven't been able to get much work done.  Every time I sat down to begin working, I just ended up not being able to start on either the persistance manager or the airship pilot systems.  As for the airship pilot systems, I haven't quite figured out what the UI for that is going to be, partially because I haven't yet made a prototype for that.  Well I did at one point make a prototype for balloon physics, but not for the actual player interface.

As for save load, I feel like I need to understand what the hell is fucking happening to me...adfjkls;adfjklsadfjkls
