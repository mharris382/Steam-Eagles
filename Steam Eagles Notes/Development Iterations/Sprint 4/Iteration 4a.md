Next Iteration: 


## Goal
recently I have been feeling that there is a lot of technical debt that needs to be addressed in this project.  For that reason I started widespread use of Zenject throughout the project.  However, I have needed to become refamiliarized with the framework which has slowed things down a bit.  I believe that with full integration, in the long term, Zenject will greatly speed up development and iteration time; even though in the short term it has a very large initial cost
