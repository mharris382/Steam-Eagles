# Iteration 29: Steam Power Network Unit Tests
Previous Iteration: [[Iteration 28 - Pipe Network]]
Next Iteration: 


## Goal
create unit tests to verify the functionality of the steam pipe network, prior to integrating it with the other game systems (i.e the Machines and the Pipe Tilemaps)

### Purpose
verify that the steam pipe network behaves as expected and is fully independent from all existing systems

### Hypothesis

Let's break this down into several units:
- modifying the topology of the network by
	- adding or removing pipe nodes
	- adding or removing inflow nodes
	- adding or removing outflow nodes
- processing the state of the network
- reacting to changes in the state of the network


I need to figure out what core logic exists within my system
