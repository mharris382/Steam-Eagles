- Spriteshapes are really weird
	- you have to set a node as a corner and have other non corner nodes in order to make an actual corner
- Rule tiles!
	- Scale the grids with powers of 2 for easy variety
	- Use tags for now since we're just making the layout
	- Make the ruletile pictures white/gray so that they can be shaded
- The level takes place inside a factory
	- all machines are gas-powered
	- Rube Goldberg esque feel
	- Lots of movement (conveyor belts, things falling into bucket and being transformed)
