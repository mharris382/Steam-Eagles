#reflection 

I'm switching roles. Since I wasn't level designing, I was being *that* person -- the one that makes a promise and then doesn't follow through, leaving everyone worse off. So instead I'm going to be an artist. Apparently there actually aren't any of those currently working on the project, so I'll do the art (for now at least). 

Big visual thing #1 is **the UI**. Max realized that  just adding the fun spinning-gear ui made the game way more fun, so I'm going to do some UI work because apparently even a simple little UI can make a *huge* difference. 

So here's to new beginnings, and awesome UIs.
