## Powering up a reactor

### From a Battery
- battery in the airship is charged from the ground by a normal steam engine
- reactors are used on the airship and need to be jumpstarted for liftoff
- **players need to:**
	1. disconnect the ground engine from the airship's battery
	2. reroute reactor connections so that it powers itself instead of being powered by the battery (battery storage will run out eventually)
